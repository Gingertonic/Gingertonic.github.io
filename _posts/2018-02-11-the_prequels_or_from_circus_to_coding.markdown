## **From Circus to Coding**
Hai der. Thanks for coming by. I'm Beth, nice to meet you. What's your name? 
*(Actually you can scroll on down to the bottom to let me know in Important Scientific Research or follow [this mysterious link](https://goo.gl/forms/gbItbt8VlW7nPgpn2))*

But enough about you let's talk about **me**. I am a mature student. How jarring does that sound? I was glad to be told recently that actually even at age 22 one can be considered a 'mature student' which did help ease the pain a little, to know that I have been one with no pain at all for 2 of the past 8 years already. That was after I had finished my 'immature student' period studying how to play the recorder. 

*(yes you read that correctly. I, in fact, have a BMus Honours Degree in playing the recorder awarded from the prestigious [Royal College of Music](http://www.rcm.ac.uk/) in London town, capital city of the United Kingdom which is indeed my country of birth. Although not the 'motherland' as that would be Cornwall, south west England. Kernow bys vyken and all that.)*

After I wore my fancy (fake)-fur-lined cape and received my certificate in Playing the Recorder, I ran away with the circus. I joined the merry band at [Giffords Circus](http://www.giffordscircus.com/) in England for two years. In between I went to [Les Amis d'Onno](https://www.lesamisdonno.com/) in Scotland (I went play with ponies but instead ended up making a customised iPad-Mac networking app which allowed me to control the show tech booth from on stage. I didn't know a thing about show control, networking or writing apps so how no-one got hurt mentally or physically is still a miracle.)

*(I did finally get to play with ponies - well, Andalusian PRE stallions - when I went to work on a finca in southern Spain for 2 months as a working student, had to get it out of my system, you know.)*

**I came to realise three things** in those 2 years after graduation from RCM:
1. I was technically very accomplished on my instruments *(okay I admit I also studied clarinet, flute and saxophone, not just recorder. But recorder was and still is my main ting*)
2. I however lacked confidence and skills to actually express **me** in my playing I was happy to emulate other composers, players, teachers, but it was going to be a whole new thing to develop the self-confidence to be me. I'm still working on this.
3. I really liked making that app and running show control for the Les Amis show

So I embarked on working on items 1 & 2 as I figured that was more acheiveable (ha!).

I did this by nabbing a place in the inaugral cohort of students at [Berklee College of Music's graduate campus in Valencia, Spain](https://valencia.berklee.edu/). I was in the Contemporary Studio Performance class of 2015. It was amazing and I met musicians from all over the world all with different backgrounds to share. 

*You can listen to some of the sounds I was making at Berklee by hitting the play button at the top of this page or by following [this link to my Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/beth-schofield/sets/portfolio-woodwinds) .*


There were also some **very** fancy studios with shiny buttons thus it took very little persuasion from the Tech program director to convince me to stay a second year this time in the Music Technology and Innovation program. It was humbling, inspiring and frustrating. My coffee and kebab intake had never been, and never again will be so high. I learnt all I could learn about the shiny buttons and most importantly, started to learn how to code. 

Thanks to our Prince-loving, Bird-is-the-Word-jiving professor, [Ben Houge](http://www.benhouge.com/), I was introduced to a world of programming logic via [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) and [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/). I started making pieces of code which I could interact with using my acoustic instruments. It was awesome. Here's one of my favourites performed by the inimitable, incredible [Ganavya](https://www.ganavya.com/). 
A trio of sorts comprised of Ganvya (live), Ganavya (prerecorded samples) and live code running which is actually listening to her live voice and working with her. 
**She is not bound to the rules of the code, the code is waiting for her and responding to her.**

*"Alright,"* I hear you say, *"so you understand some logic, but isn't Max just dragging boxes around?"*
Well, ya got me! The reason Max and Pure Data (the free open source alternative to Max) are so accessible and popular with installation designers and artists, is that the interface get rid of the need to know how to literally write code. It's a bit like a way more advanced, less colourful version of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), the awesome intro to coding program written by the epic people at MIT.
But it is very powerful and if you dig deep enough it's even more flexible than you might first be led to believe. It was certainly enough to befuddle me for a while and give me a taste for what is possible when given a blank canvas and a code-logic patinbrush.
I'm certainly not done with using Max/Pd, it's really perfect for a lot of the things I want to do.

*"Okay, so why learn 'real coding' if you are already happy with what you've got?"*
So, it's not super easy to share a program made in Max. It's not impossible by any means but it's not like I can pop it into the web. Well, you can in theory but it's a bit of a pain, it's hardly being done anywhere (actually, I've only heard about it not even seen any examples) and even when up you'd have to have a dedicated server running Max somewhere, a metric shed-load of RAM and blahblahblah, sounds like a hassle right?
But hey, look! We have this awesome thing called the web and super integrated ways to put things on it and share things all over it anywhere, so why not use that?! 

Some questions I've started ruminated on recently as I've been working through the Flatiron prep materialL 
* **what would an online AV installation look like?**
* **what would the code look like if I remade** *(ooo refactored, I just learned that word, I'mma use it now)* ***He sees the Shore* in a way that Ganavya could just load up a web page and perform it literally online?**
* **is this medium of code what I've been looking to actually bring my ideas to life?**

And my answers as of right now:
* Good question Beth, you should get on that and find out
* Probably complicated but that's a sweet concept. Let's keep learning about about audio integration and perhaps made a refactoring of that piece a slowburning side project
* 100% yes, I believe it is


After Berklee I went and did my stint as a broke studio intern in NYC. It was pretty great and I was very upset when my visa was up but after I was gently kicked out of the USA, I quickly took a job as Head Tech for a live AV company which was scary and I wasn't really qualified to do it but I was given qute a nice apartment by the beach on Crete, Greece and then Tenerife in the Canarias so it all evened out in the end. I learned loads, including that I never want to be in a middle-management position again.

I surivived to the end of that contract but politely declined their next offer and instead ran back to the circus, this time spending 2 years in Denmark, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. I loved almost every minute of it (I do not function in the cold so winter was less fun living in my van.) 
*Speaking of my van, here she is. Her name is Nana:*

Pretty cool, right! She has been with me through a lot in a short time. Currently she is resting in Cornwall whilst I'm in Australia (story for another day)

It was in Nana, this past freezing winter, when I stepped up my coding game. An email from Flatiron got my attention - they were running a beta of an Accelarated Bootcamp Prep course, intensive for 2 weeks, online but with scheduled lectures at the weekends which we could join on Zoom from anywhere in the world. On tour we have a lot of free time but not enough to go anywhere so I love a good project. I signed up with fervour and hoped I would scrape through the first session. Rather than scrape through I found that I **loved** it! Everyone was up for it, we were learning so much, really fast, Avi is a brilliant teacher and long story short, 3 weeks later I was signed up for the full online Fullstack Web Dev course with deferred enrollment to start Feb 4th.

And here I am. Cheers to that.

## **What now?**
Now, with the help of Flatiron, I am focusing on learning how to learn how to code *(nope, no typos/repeats there)*. On a personal level, I'm doing it for the reasons I mentioned above. On a larger, more general level, I really believe that learning this skill is the best way to stay on top of the very swift progress which is happening around us. I don't want to be washed under, unable to control my movements as these waves of progress envelop us. I want to be up on the surface, riding the waves right as they are breaking, before even, knowing how to take and release control to make it the best ride possible.
As I'm really no good at surfing ocean waves, coding and riding the metaphoricals is my best option here and it feels **so good** to be taking this into my own hands after years of wondering about it making little shuffling movements towards the edge, I've made it now and I'm ready to jump off and fly!

## **Closing, Upcoming and Opening words**
Thanks for reading, if you would like to take part in some Important Scientific Research, it's just below!
Look out for my upcoming posts including:

*Episode 4: A New Fork ("Who you calling 'Git'?)*

*Coders in the Wild*: I went the launch event of Code Like A Girl in Adelaide where there were some interesting speakers, I'll be sharing some of their thoughts with you here.

*Get in the Flow* I'll be doing a series of short posts about my work flow too (with a hint of life flow in there perhaps). I imagine this will change a lot throughout my journey in code so it will be interesting to document how these changes happen!
