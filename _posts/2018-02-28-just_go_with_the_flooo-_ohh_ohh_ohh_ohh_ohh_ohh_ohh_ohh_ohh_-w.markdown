First off, if you got the *Finding Nemo: The Musical* reference in the title, 10 points to Gryffindor!

### Why talk about workflow?
Like it or not, I have a theory that secretly most of us are more interested in the workflow than the work. Or at least, we can use it as a nice distraction. How many of us just *love* stationery shops? How many times have you spent ages perfecting your timetable or schedule only to realise that you just used up all that nice time by creating said schedule?
I've done it countless times so much that last year I kind of stopped doing anything that required any planning as I knew I'd spend so long planning I'd never get it done anyway so why bother? *(it wasn't a fantastic time)* 

My salvation? In my consultation of Dr Google to find out what was wrong with me *(a story for another time on another platform)* I re-came across the concept of Bullet Journals. I'd heard of them before, seen pictures of epic grand doodles of stunning design values and exquisite penmanship, both of which I could do for about 10 minutes and then give in to 'lazy hand'. So I had discounted the Bullet journal "fad" as not for me. 
But in this particular video, a girl who was just like me, was using a Bullet Journal (BuJo) in it's purest format. No fancy designs, just as originally intended by [Ryder Carroll](http://bulletjournal.com/). 
I very almost failed at the first hurdle, getting caught up in finding The Perfect Notebook. Luckily I was living in Denmark at the time and beautiful stationery with just what you're looking for is easy to find. I picked up an A6 Leuchtturm hardcover with dotted paper. It came with two ribbon markers, an expandable pocket at the back and pre-page numbered. It was also orange - perfection.

With a resolution to be OKAY with making a potential mess, I followed the super easy steps to get it going and within minutes I had an easy-to-use, zero-effort-to-maintain analog system for my life. Since that I've not been anywhere without my BuJo. I lost it once and had a bit of a breakdown so I guess I'm still working on detachment but eh, it's a start!

My orange friend just offered up his last page to my scribblings and fortunately I found the single supplier in Australia and was abe to order another. I've stuck with Leuchtturm but gone with a soft-cover, thin, Nordic-Blue number this time. I had it all setup within minutes again and had another super productive day thanks to BuJo magic-in-simplicity. For more info on BuJos I highly suggest skipping the Pinterest boards and going straight to the simple [official website](http://bulletjournal.com/get-started/) which will take you through the basics. You can go fancy from there if you like but there's no requirement to. I quite feel that many of the fancy spread designs you can find, actually detract from the point of BuJoing but each to their own.

<br>

***Anyway, since my BuJo enlightenment*** I started to slowly take more ownership and interest in my workflow. I knew that anything I did needed to be simple and useful, not a fancy concept that took more time to maintain than it did save you time to actually do what I wanted and needed to do.
<br>
<br>


### So as well as the BuJo, what tools am I using?
**MacBook Pro**
The hub of my digital creative life. I developed an extreme allergy to Windows circa 2011. I'm sure it's great for the right person (my partner is a Windows lifer, no changing him I'm sure) but for me, my MBP is just perfect in every way. As musician, video-maker, programmer, media-consuming-and-creating creature, there's nothing better... 
<br>

EXCEPT the MBPs one major flaw... the Pricetag. My last MBP died drowning in milk. My current one I got at an absolute bargain because I have some awesome friends, but still, it's a chunk of cash. My current one had a near-death-experience this Christmas thanks to a hot chocolate. I maintain that this one didn't die as it was almond milk rather than cow milk. Just another reason to stay vegan aha...!
<br>


But the hot chocolate scare made me realise that I really can't keep on bringing my MBP to cafes, throwing it in a backpack... I'm just not one of those people who mollycoddle their things. So enter the...

<br>
**Chromebook Asus C213NA**
literally designed to be thrown around a classroom, have liquid spilt on it, dropped on the floor...
I had to have one and at a fraction of the price of even my 2nd hand, mates rates, MBP, I ordered one as soon as I could. It has been perfect. I use it for admin at home, I take it out to cafes, it's already been dropped on the floor and had a drink over it and it's perfect, good as new! It's got a great matte touchscreen, it's convertible to all sorts of configurations and it's an all-round little warrior. It runs Chrome OS which is Google's own flavour of Linux. I'm going to partition the drive soon and use crouton to be able to switch between another version of Linux and setup a basic local environment. I've used the in-browser Learn IDE on the Chromebook in a cafe and it was fine but I much prefer not working in-browser. 
<br>

<br>
<br>


**Evernote**
I've used [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/) for a while in other work and I just love how dead easy it is. I usually put things in there which I likely won't reference again but I should probably keep just in case. My next stationery purchase will be an Evernote Smart notebook (Moleskine make them) to test out for fun.
I usually stub out my blog posts there or keep temporary to-do lists for my online job.
Before my BuJo life, I used Evernote a lot more. It's not perfect for that use but it's okay to keep one sane when needed...
<br>
<br>

**Toggl**
My Flatiron Educational Coach, Katie, pointed me towards [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/). It's great. It's a very simple way to track how much time you're spending on various projects. There's a Chrome extension so you don't have to have the webpage open all the time but to be honest I like seeing the little graphs and reports it makes so I usually have it open!

<br>
<br>
**Learn IDE**
At the moment I'm using the Learn IDE made by Flatiron for most of my actual coding. I will soon be setting up my local environment and using the Learn IDE has made me feel comfortable with what it will be like rather than jumping into the unknown.

<br>
<br>

**Cloud based IDEs**
I'm not as excited about cloudbased IDEs as I was initially now that I'm going to partition my Chromebook, but I'm interested in trying out the following just for interest:
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)
[Codenvy](https://codenvy.com/)
[codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/)


<br>
<br>

**AAQ**
Ask A Question is a total lifesaver. Built-in to the [Learn](https://learn.co/) platform, I can ask any question at any time and usually within seconds I am chatting with another member of the community to try and resolve my query. Almost always a Tech Coach is on the scene within minutes and if it's just not sinking in, they will hop on to a screenshare with you. These people are amazing.

<br>
<br>

**Slack**
I use [Slack](https://slack.com/) with another job so I was already familiar with it and I like to keep an eye on the Flatiron Slack channels. Things move quick there so make sure to note down any useful things you pick up. It's a great place to chat with the whole community outside of the study groups, lectures and AAQ.

<br>
<br>


**BuJo**
We've said enough about this!

<br>
<br>
**General Wellness!**
Also in the past year I've really taken a step back to look at my wellbeing both physical and mental. I consider these areas to be top level important elements in your productivity and effectiveness. I do (aerial) yoga, I go on the occasional jog, I eat what my body tells me I want and need. (note this was different to my mind initially but that's now changing!)
Bonus: I got on a bicycle for the first time in... a while... yesterday and I'm a very nervous, pretty rubbish cyclist but have a goal of being able to safely cycle into the city by the end of March. I'll keep us all posted... My bike is awesome though. I picked it up for $30 Australian and it's an ex-Australia Post bike. I love it.

**Events**
Recently I went to My First Coding Event! In person, with other people! It was the launch event of [Code Like A Girl](http://codelikeagirl.com/), a Melbourne-based company who are actively trying to change the face of the coding world to include more people who identify as anything other than male. It was cool to see so many other people there, especially as I've not met that many programmers in real-life! We had talks from three women from very different backgrounds who are making their mark in the tech world. I'm hoping they have another event soon, although they did admit the catering was not going to be as fancy next time!

### Is it working?
YES! It's working a *treat*. My studies are going great, I look forward to getting up and devoting my mornings to learning new, weird things immersed in my simple but effective workspace! 

**Proof please?**
Proof coming up in next blog post where I look at some ***really weird*** code which has made me genuinely feel like I'm writing in a Completely Foreign language. REGEX. We only touch on it briefly in the course and it would be tempting to skim over it and not really understand what's going on but this morning I've cracked it, at least I've cracked the first layers. Here's a taster...

```
text.scan(/\bun\S*ing\b/)
```
and
```
phone.match(/^\D*(\d\D*){10}$/) ? true : false
```

THAT'S PROPER WEIRD, RIGHT?! Ruby-land where everything is pretty much how you say it, seems far away when you start reading this stuff but it's startign to look familiar. Put a pin in it, we'll chat next time...!
